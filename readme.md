# Exponentialistics Pipes

... is a mod-independant pipe system, similar to [LogisticsPipes](https://github.com/RS485/LogisticsPipes/tree/dev-mc1122) but with:
 * [OpenComputers](https://oc.cil.li/) support
 * Light models for blocks and items (not multi-kilobytes obj files I mean)
 * No next-gen, not working recipes
 * Not a single line of code stolen from Buildcraft

*Wait a minute, this is just a incomplete and bad copy of Logistics Pipes ?*

Yes. See above.

Logistics Pipes is released under the [MMPL](https://www.mod-buildcraft.com/MMPL-1.0.txt) license,
which mostly covers the code, thus I don't really know if I can release this mod on Curseforge of something.

There will be some original ideas tho, I have a list somewhere...

## TODO List

 * [x] Actual pipes
 * [x] Items routing
 * [x] Item requests and providers
 * [x] OpenComputers integration
 * [x] Advanced pipe filters (fuzzy, oredict...) and prioritized sorting
 * [x] Flowing items rendering
 * [ ] Fluid pipes
 * [ ] Optional energy requirement (w/ GTCE support)
 * [ ] Multipart support
 * [ ] Better pathfinder
 * [ ] Compatiblity with other mods' pipes (buildcraft, thermal dynamics, etc.)
